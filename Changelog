2015-10-09
*bugfix: handles cases where some samples have no lines for certain contiges (eg chrY on females)
*bugfix: problem with truncating .dpt files on agg ingest1
*chromosome string will now be printed, rather than its htslib integer rid
*homref GQ is now rounded down to nearest multiple of 10 to aid compression

*added INFO/GN (genotype counts)

2015-04-17
*initdb.py now submits jobs that run -nprocess processes, suitable for clusters where an entire node is reserved per job
*added the updatedb.py script which performs bulk ingestion of new samples into the database, also useful for adding samples that failed initial ingestion
*collate step is now performed by multi_collate.py which performs whole genome collation/concatenation with nprocess processes
*FORMAT field now includes DP/AD/GQ for any genotype containing and ALT (todo: homref)

2015-03-20
