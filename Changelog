*added the update-info.c plugin
*minor bugfix when calculating INFO/PF with agg genotype

2015-11-19
*updatePF.c bug fix

2015-10-29
*updatePF.c plugin added

2015-10-19
*added the make_chunk.py script

2015-10-09
*bugfix: handles cases where some samples have no lines for certain contiges (eg chrY on females)
*bugfix: problem with truncating .dpt files on agg ingest1
*chromosome string will now be printed, rather than its htslib integer rid
*homref GQ is now rounded down to nearest multiple of 10 to aid compression
*changed agg ingest1 output to .bcf+.tmp file to avoid confusion

2015-09-08
*bugfix: DP/GQ were not set correctly for homref genotypes in certain circumstances (issue 3)
*added more informative output agg ingest2 progress

2015-09-01
*agg ingest2 gives meaningful error when multisample-bcf provided as input
*agg ingest2 now strips all INFO fields upon merge operation
*changed ingest2 order of operations. variants now produced first then the .dpt file

2015-08-21
*agg now sets FILTER=. consistently
*fixed a bug caused by "hemizygous" calls present in input gvcfs
*added GN field to hwe plugin
*tweaks to header/compilation so old version of gcc will work

2015-08-11
*agg3 ready for testing

2015-08-04
*agg2 deprecated and moved to agg2/
*new agg3 added to agg3/

2015-06-04
*agg repo on private github

2015-06-03
*moved to vt for variant normalisation
*fixed the AD splitting issue by reheadering the vcfs upon ingestion
*added INFO/GN (genotype counts)

2015-04-17
*initdb.py now submits jobs that run -nprocess processes, suitable for clusters where an entire node is reserved per job
*added the updatedb.py script which performs bulk ingestion of new samples into the database, also useful for adding samples that failed initial ingestion
*collate step is now performed by multi_collate.py which performs whole genome collation/concatenation with nprocess processes
*FORMAT field now includes DP/AD/GQ for any genotype containing and ALT (todo: homref)

2015-03-20
*initial version deployed to Cambridge HPC
